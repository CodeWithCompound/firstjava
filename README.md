## first java
Tiny test project while i poke Java to see what happens.

---

## current features
- asks for two numbers  
- adds them together  
- gives you the median  
- refuses to work if you feed it garbage input

---

## goals
- learn how Java input works  
- understand functions + return types  
- avoid at any given chance: NullPointerException

More features... maybe.  
Or maybe this stays a cursed calculator fragment forever.  
We'll see.
